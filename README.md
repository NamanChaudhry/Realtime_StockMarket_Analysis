# Realtime Stock Market Analysis using Kafka and PostgreSQL
## Introduction
This project aims to provide a realtime stock market analysis platform using Apache Kafka for data streaming and PostgreSQL for data storage and analysis. The system captures transactional data of stocks and bonds in real-time, processes it, and stores it for further analysis and visualization.

## Features
Realtime data ingestion using Apache Kafka
Data storage and management with PostgreSQL
Data processing and transformation pipelines
Realtime analytics and visualization
Scalable and fault-tolerant architecture
## Architecture
The architecture of the project is designed to handle high-frequency stock market data in real-time. Here is a high-level overview of the components involved:
Data Ingestion: Apache Kafka is used to stream stock market data in real-time.
Data Processing: Kafka Streams or Apache Flink can be used to process the data.
Data Storage: Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL for persistent storage and querying.
Data Analysis: SQL queries and analysis tools are used to perform realtime analysis on the stored data.
Data Visualization: Tools like Grafana or Tableau can be used to visualize the data and analysis results.
